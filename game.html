        <p id="intro">
            A lot of modern AAA game titles miss the mark on what makes a good game.
            <br>  
            However some games in the modern era figure it out and as such become classics.
        </p>
        <h3 class="content">There are 3 key elements to good game design</h3><br>
        <p class="content">
            1. Mechanics that work well with the style and feel of the game
            <br>
            2. Levels or encounters that push you into said mechanics
            <br>
            3. A sense of player progression that happens as the game goes on
