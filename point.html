        <h1>The Big Three of Understanding Game Design</h1><br><br>
        <img src="../images/controller.jpg" alt="A ps4 controller"><br><br>
        <br>
        <h3>Number One: Mechanics that work with the style and feel of the game</h3><br>
        <p>This one is super important.  If your game mechanics dont fit your style of game,<br>
             then it will feel wrong to use those mechanics and the player will have a bad time playing your game.  <br>
             <br>
             For example: A infinite ammo perk in a survival horror game.</p><br>
        <h3>Number Two: Levels or encounters that push you into said mechanics</h3><br>
        <p>
            This point works as a follow-up to point one.  Games should structure encounters that push you to use the games mechanics. <br>
            If this doesn't happen then the player will never use these cool mechanics.
            <br><br>
            For example: Being given a double jump mechanic <br>
            but every encounter and/or bossfight has attacks where you can avoid them just by moving over without jumping.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Number Three: A sense of player progression that happens as the game goes on</h3><br>
        <p>
            Point three is probably the most important one.  Games should have the player feel like the game is progressing. <br>
            What that means is that the player should be getting stronger and more skilled, <br>
            however more enemies and encounters should take place to test the players ablilities.
            <br><br>
            For example: The game having a system of uprades that make your current ablilities stronger.
